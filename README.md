# Machine-Learning

In this notebook, I used the Obesity Level dataset. Using this dataset I use Logistic, Naive Bayes, and Neural network algorithms and also compare these three algorithms using different activation functions, learning rates and maximum iteration.

The dataset I choose from kaggle. Here is the dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels
